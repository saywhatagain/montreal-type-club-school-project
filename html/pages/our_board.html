<h2 class="pinkTitle">ELITZA CINDERELLA</h2>

<p class="paraBig">
  
  Once upon a time, there was a widower who married a proud and haughty
woman as his second wife. She had twodaughters, who were equally vain and
selfish. By his first wife, he'd had a beautiful young daughter, a girl of unparalleled
goodness and sweet temper. The stepmother and her daughters forced
the first daughter into servitude, where she was made to work day and night
in menial chores. 

</p>

<p class="paraBig">
  
After the girl's chores were done for the day, she would retire
to the barren and cold room given to her, and would curl up near the fireplace
in an effort to stay warm. She would often arise covered in cinders, giving rise
to the mocking nickname "Cinderella". Cinderella bore the abuse patiently and
dared not tell her father, since his wife controlled him entirely.

<h2 class="pinkTitle">HASSAN ALADDIN</h2>

<p class="paraBig">
  
 With the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and
marries Princess Badroulbadour, the Emperor's daughter (after magically foiling
her marriage to the vizier's son). The genie builds Aladdin a wonderful
palace – a far more magnificent one than that of the Emperor himself. The sorcerer
returns and is able to get his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's
wife, who is unaware of the lamp's importance, by offering to exchange
"new lamps for old".

<h2 class="pinkTitle">LUCIE “SNOW WHITE”</h2>

<p class="paraBig">
  
At the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during
a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three
drops of blood dripping into the freshly fallen snow on the black windowsill.


</p>

<p class="paraBig">
  
Admiring the beauty of the resulting color combination, she says to herself,
"Oh how I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as
red as blood, and hair as black as ebony". Soon after that, the Queen gives
birth to a baby girl who is as white as snow, as red as blood, and with hair as
black as ebony. They name her 'Snow White', but sadly, the Queen dies after
giving birth to her.

At the christening of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven fairies
are invited to be godmothers to the infant princess. At the banquet back at the
palace, the fairies seat themselves with a golden casket containing golden
jeweled utensils laid before them.

<h2 class="pinkTitle">SEBASTIEN PIERRE HOOD</h2>

<p class="paraBig">
  
Sébastien Pierre Hood is a heroic outlaw in English folklore, and was also a
highly skilledarcher and swordsman. Although such behaviour was not part of
his original character, since the beginning of the 19th century he has become
known for "robbing from the rich and giving to the poor", assisted by a group
of fellow outlaws known as his "Merry Men". Traditionally, Robin Hood and his
men are depicted wearing Lincoln green clothes. The origin of the legend is
asserted by some to have been actual outlaws, or ballads or tales of outlaws.
